<p>The LabBot framework for controlling psychophysical experiments and collecting data.  </p>

<p>The framework is a collection of Objective-C and Swift classes written using the Cocoa framework to control various aspects of psychophysical experiments using an Apple computer.  It is intended to an alternative to more popular psychophysics frameworks that are clumbsy, unstable or dependant upon expensive platforms.  As it is written for Cocoa, you need only an Apple computer running OS X 10.9 to make use of LabBot.  </p>

<p>LabBot is added to as I find reusable code in my own experimental setups. At this stage it is pre-release because there is not much to it-there are some key pending additions-and because some of the exisiting classes are still in active development. Although the classes are tested and should be stable they may change ddrastically between versions.</p>

<p>If you find LabBot useful and want to add your own class or tweak and exisiting one please submit a push request so others can benifit.  If you find a short comming or an apparent bug please create an issue in the github repository.</p>

<h5><a id="extensions" class="anchor" href="#extensions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extensions</h5>
<h6>LabBot-Jack</h6>
<p>This is an extension framework to allow the sampling of data with a LabJack data aqusition device.  This extension is in early development and currently specifically supports the LabJack U6 only.  LabBot-Jack is dependant upon LabBot and the most recent binary comes bundled with the LabBot binary.
<br>LabBot-Jack is dependant upon both the libUSB-1.x library and the LabJack driver being installed and linkable from /usr/lib/.</p>
