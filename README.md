LabBot
======

The LabBot framework for controlling psychophysical experiments and collecting data.  

The framework is a collection of Objective-C classes written using the Cocoa framework to control various aspects of psychophysical experiments using an Apple computer. Unfortunately I have found that the popular psychophysics frameworks tend to be slow, unstable and dependant on expensive, and often restrictive, platforms (e.g. Matlab, LabView). In contrast I have found that, at least for my work, the Apple Cocoa framework is flexible and straightforward to use for experimental control (although sometimes sill slow).  As it is written for Cocoa, you need only an Apple computer running OS X 10.9 to make use of LabBot.  

LabBot is added to as I find reusable code in my own experimental setups. At this stage it is pre-release because there is not much to it-there are some key pending additions-and because some of the exisiting classes are still in active development. In the future new classes will only be added to the framework after they are proven and, at least in my experience, stable.  

If you fine LabBot useful and want to add your own class or tweak and exisiting one please submit a push request so others can benifit.  If you find a short comming or an apparent bug please let me know.
